# Single Shot MultiBox Detector on Face Detection

This repo is forked from https://github.com/HiKapok/SSD.TensorFlow. It is fine-tuned on WIDER-FACE dataset to detect face, and added support for MobileNetv2 as backbone net.

This repository contains codes of the reimplementation of [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) in TensorFlow. If your goal is to reproduce the results in the original paper, please use the official [codes](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).
